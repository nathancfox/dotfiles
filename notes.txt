What I want to be able to do on a new box with internet connection:

 1. dot files: bashrc, vimrc
 2. set up my folders: software, sandbox, landingpad
 3. install miniconda + basic packages: numpy, pandas, ipython, seaborn, matplotlib, pyyaml (needed for dotbot scripts)
 4. Set up ssh: download public keys
 5. install vim, git locally
 6. check for basic utilities, e.g. htop and install locally if not already available
    wget, tar, make
 7. install my custom programs and libraries

back up existing dotfiles
update paths
